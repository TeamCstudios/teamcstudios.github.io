Keemstar wants to invade Leafy because he roasted him
on Twitter. To do so, he forms an alliance with DanTDM and
Pyrocynical to invade Belgium and France. They crush Bashur in
Belgium and begin to move into France. Leafy asks the help
of h3h3 and jacksepticeye. They agree to blockade the Strait
of Gibralter and the coast of Sweeden, Germany, and Denmark.
This causes the Central Alliance to invade the ORMY (in search
of more coast to continue trade) and the ORMY joins in against
the Central Alliance. The Mindcrack Confederacy see their
opportunity and begin to push back the ORMY in Africa.
This begins World War 3.
