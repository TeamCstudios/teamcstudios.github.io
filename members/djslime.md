# Djslime

Also known as DjSlimeBoi, DjSlimeBoyTCGM, or ADjslime, he was the longest-lasting member other than MrJoCrafter.

## Why he joined

DjSlime joined TCGM in 2013 because he wanted to be in a YouTube series and MrJoCrafter wanted someone else to record with. Later that same year, WolfGirl joined the channel and it was rebranded "Team CStudios | Gaming + More!". After WolfGirl left due to scheduling conflicts, DjSlime was the only member left until AsianEkin13579 was brought on in 2014 and shortly left, and then in 2015, Chew, ThePlayaKing, and ZachAttack joined.
